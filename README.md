# Reaching Passionate Developers in a Sea of Data. Selecting Developers Across GitHub Projects

Abstract


Programming is multi-faceted, inherently involving many skills in a developer skill stack. With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub, another tier of developers selection comes possible. Using GitHub data is possible to extract several skills from a developer. These developers have the opportunity to contribute to projects from different organizations and collaborate with various developers from around the world. However, many companies do not use all the power of these social coding tools to improve their selection processes and often continue with conventional selection processes. This papers propose a method to extract, select and rank developers fairly, based on the knowledge they produce on GitHub. Further, we present a way to visualize the developers technical skills to technical and non-technical users. To evaluate our method, we compare the selected profiles from GitHub with profiles of these developers on the social network LinkedIn to see if what they report there matches what they produce in GitHub. We also survey postgraduate students to see if our indications from developers are appropriate. Our results shown that 89\% of selected GitHub developers reported their skills in social networking sites as LinkedIn, accordingly with ranking made by our method and that the ranking made by our method is related to the ranking made by survey respondents.
